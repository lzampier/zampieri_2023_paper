## Modelling the winter heat conduction through the sea ice system during MOSAiC

Python code to solve the 2d heat equation on MOSAiC transects and postprocessing notebooks related to the manuscript "Modelling the winter heat conduction through the sea ice system during MOSAiC" by Zampieri at al. 2023. 

The code is commented and hopefully understandable. The figures of that paper can be reproduced here starting from a set of postprocessed data. Any feedback is welcome to further improve this code collection. If something is not clear I invite you to get in touch with me by opening an issue. I will answer and try to solve your problem as soon as possible.
